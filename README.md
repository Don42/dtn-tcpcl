# dtn-tcpcl
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Don42/dtn-tcpcl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Don42/dtn-tcpcl)

This is an experimental implementation of ietf drafts *dtn-bpbis* and *dtn-tcpclv4*. 
It is not expected that this will be useful to anyone, but aims at being a learning opportunity.

## Scope
For now I will only implement tcpcl and bundle parsing to allow this crate to be used in a
DTN endpoint application. Routing and other features of a DTN node might be implemented later.
Much later.

## Contributing
Since I want this to be a learning opportunity I don't want to take in new code right now. 
I would however appreciate tips and information on how to properly implement something like this,
especially architecture-wise.
This might change in the future should I ever get this in a usable state.

## License
Haven't decided on a license yet.
